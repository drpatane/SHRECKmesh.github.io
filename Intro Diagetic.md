* Now talking in #news
* Topic is 'check out this latest bullshit from the Camarilla'
* Set by DraCOOLa

<DraCOOLa> [ADMIN] so called "Prince" Castor don't let anyone record his pronouncements anymore but here's the juicy bits:

<DraCOOLa> [ADMIN] "Abscence of the primogen notwithstanding, we emphatically deny rumors that the Anarch insurrection and their degenerate thinblood allies control the Montrose and Third Ward neighborhoods." 

<DraCOOLa> [ADMIN] "Sheriff Rosenberg is now authorized to punish any Kindred heard fear-mongering about werewolf sightings in the Sam Houston Forest. Don't test her."

<DraCOOLa> [ADMIN] "We grow tired of reminding you not to discuss matters of unlife with clergy of the Church of Rome. We understand the importance of faith to some of you, but breaching Masquerade to the Inquisition will not save your soul. You have far more to fear from us." ...as you can tell, same shit, different night

<Gen13> lmao typical cammy lies. can't walk a block in third ward without ten different thinbloods trying to sell you their concotions. 

<user451> lol talking online. masquerade breach much? enjoy getting staked bro

<DraCOOLa> [ADMIN] Cammies still think BBS is new besides you're here aren't you? You're just as dead

<WLF_HNTR_X> Can we get back on topic please? do they honestly expect us to believe the werewolves aren't a threat this close to the city? How do they explain all the howling and the disappearances up north? 

<DraCOOLa> [ADMIN] not this again, the only furries in the woodlands are the human kind

<WLF_HNTR_X> ok but what about the things from bayou coming up to eat us???
