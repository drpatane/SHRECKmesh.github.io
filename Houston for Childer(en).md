Neither sect has full control over Houston, despite the Camarilla's claims to the contrary. Both the Cam and the Anarchs are vying for the top spot, but both are aware that they are not powerful enough to take control on their own:
		- Werewolf threats from the North
		- Montrose Emancipated Zone of thin bloods
		- Second Inquisition via the Catholic Church, ICE, FBI
		- Whatever the first nations are doing
 As a result, both major sects are happy with working with the other and using them, the plan is to always kill or subsume the others once the time is right
Camarilla control fell apart when the entire primogen council up and left in 2019 feeling the call of Gehenna. Except for Tremere, whose entire haven experienced the horrors of white phosphorus first hand. As yet nobody has claimed responsibility, but its timing close to the fall of the Prime Chantry in Austria has the kindred rumor mill whispering about Second Inquisition presence in Houston.

October 31, 2019: The entire Court and (most) of the elders sitting on the Primogen council simply fucked off. The few who bothered to communicate to the rest of the city's kindred spoke of the "Beckoning."

November 1, 2019: The remains of the Tremere Primogen are found inside his inner sanctum. Hidden in a secret library complex underneath Rice University's Library, it is found after smoke alarms go off in the main stack. Camarilla agents inside local and federal law enforcement note reports of white phosphorus residue surrounding the Primogen's former resting place. Conspiracies abound

November 5, 2019: Houston's former Seneschal, [[Castor Augustus]], appoints himself Prince. Although highly unusual, the recent abdications from the Court leave little in the way of opposition.
